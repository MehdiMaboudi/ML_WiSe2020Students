    "One of Guido van Rossums' key insights is that **code is read much more often than it is written**. The guidelines described in PEP 8 are therefore intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As The Zen of Python (PEP 20) says, **“Readability counts”** [1]. The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 guiding principles for writing computer programs that influenced the Python programming language. It was written in 1999 by software engineer Tim Peters. [2]\n",

    "1. Oftentimes, one spends hours or days working on a specific project. Once it is finished, it is rarely written again. It will, however, most definately be read again. Each time someone returns to that piece of code, they must be able to understand what it does and why it was written that way. Therefore, *readability is important*. If PEP 8 is followed, variables have been named well and it is ensured that there are enough spaces to make it easier to follow the logical steps in the code. You have also commented your code well. All this means that your code is easier to read and recall. As a beginner, following the rules of PEP 8 can make learning Python much easier. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Following PEP 8 is especially important if you are looking to work as a developer. Writing clear and readable code *shows professionalism* and will tell an employer that you understand how to structure your code well. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you have more experience writing Python code, you may *need to collaborate* with others. Writing readable code is crucial here as other people need to read and understand your code. If you have guidelines that you follow and recognize, others can read your code more easily. [3]\n"
